# LookDev Project — Personal Asset Archive

This repository contains core look development files used for material and lighting testing in 3D production workflows. It is intended for private use and version-controlled asset referencing, compatible with software such as Maya, USD-compatible viewers, and real-time engines.

## Contents

- `LookDev_Textures/` — Folder containing high-quality PBR texture maps (BaseColor, Roughness, Normal, Metalness, etc.)
- `LookDev.usda` — Universal Scene Description (USD ASCII) file referencing the textures and configured for look development workflows

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to act as a centralized, clean, and structured **LookDev testbed**, created and maintained for:

- Personal shading and lighting studies  
- Testing material setups across various render engines (e.g., V-Ray, Arnold, Unreal Engine)  
- Establishing a reference environment for texture calibration and comparison

## Key Features

- Texture paths are organized for cross-platform consistency  
- The `.usda` file is authored to reference textures relative to the asset directory  
- Designed for real-world shader pipeline simulation and visual fidelity testing  

## Important Notes

- This repository is strictly private and not intended for public distribution.
- No executable code or third-party proprietary content is included.
- All assets are original and created solely for personal and professional development.
